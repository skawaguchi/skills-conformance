# Skills Conformance

I was shown this tool while discussing software craftsmanship across IBM. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see where I might stand, and also to use for my mentees in our 1:1s.

Refer to Medium's [Engineering growth: Introduction](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework/engineering-growth-framework-overview-4e02ab330524) for more details. Here is the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EO-Dbsayn8Nz9Ii3MKcwRbt-EIJ2MjQdpoyhh0tBdZk/edit). Medium's [Snowflake](https://snowflake.medium.com/#1,4,3,1,4,3,4,3,3,2,2,3,4,2,1,3,Stephen%20Kawaguchi,Staff%20Engineer) can give you an idea of how the metrics work (although Medium itself has [evolved past using it](https://medium.engineering/engineering-growth-at-medium-4935b3234d25)).

| Skill | Milestone | Points | Justification |
| :---- | --------: | -----: | ------------- |
| **Build** |
| Mobile | 1 | 1 | Significant experience with React Native, but the bulk was set up before I joined. |
| Web Client | 4 | 12 | Long and deep experience with web clients and HTTP. Strong JavaScript knowledge, along with React. Performance optimization. | 
| Foundation | 3 | 6 | I've architected systems through major upgrades, including adjusting the architecture for better maintainability and extensibility. I've helped debugged hard problems in all manner of systems, including difficult optimizations. I've designed medium-complexity web apps. I'm still learning system design. I lack enough hands-on knowledge to feel confident in large-scale distributed systems yet. |
| Servers | 1 | 1 | I've never set up production server apps myself. However, I've done significant code reviews and integrated code. Long experience adjusting server-side code from ASP Classic, ASP.NET, Java, JSP, JSF, Ruby on Rails. I need more hands-on implementation experience. |
| *Sub-Total* | | **20** |
| **Executing** |
| Project Management | 4 | 12 | I've been a project and program manager for 4 years, and led teams and engineering orgs for another 4 years. This has tranferred very well to being able to lead projects as an architect - so without having to be part of the official chain of command, but as an advisor and influencer. |  
| Communication | 3 | 6 | Used to communicating with every level of the organization. Used to presenting for hundreds of people. Haven't done too much live public-speaking. Still working on being concise and compelling to executives - engineers seem to buy-in to messages. |
| Craft | 4 | 12 | Strong advocacy for software craft, including leading learning for topics like SOLID principles, running internal talks, providing significant TDD'd code, leading the push for better code metrics than code coverage, such as cognitive complexity and coupling metrics, and providing knowledge in code reviews. |
| Initiative | 3 | 6 | After a brief info-gathering stage, I'm always an outspoken advocate for necessary change. Areas where I've impacted include onboarding practices, hiring practices, Agile methods, DevOps practices, and leading the charge from transitioning an on-prem, monolithic product mindset to a cloud-native, microservices one. I've been sent in to help solve fundamental organizational problems. Much of my work has been contending with crippling levels of technical debt and breaking down mindsets resistant to change with facts and data. |
| *Sub-Total* | | **36** |
| **Supporting** |
| Career Development | 3 | 6 | Through 1:1s and informal mentorship, I've guided dozens of developers through their growth in soft skills as well as software engineering growth. I'm struggling to figure out how to scale this past 1:1s beyond inspiring my mentees to become mentors themselves. I've only seen limited success with this approach. | 
| Org Design | 2 | 3 | I've been studying organizational design from the perspective of aligning teams to business domains for awhile. I'm influenced by the Inverse Conway Maneuver,  Team Topologies, Systems Designs, the Spotify Model, Domain Driven Design as an organizing concept for microservices, and various DevOps books. I've never had the power to actually trigger a re-org, and nobody has listened thus far. |
| Wellbeing | 2 | 3 | I work very hard to foster a learning culture for my area. I've co-founded multiple learning clubs across organizations, contributed to the IBM Agile Academy, given multiple internal talks, and have worked to create collections of resources. I do this to make sure that my team mates are constantly challenged to grow at their own pace. I also hunt down work I believe they will find interesting. My goal is for them to be engaged, and to make sure that they have a safe space to ask questions and learn. I try to also inject as much rigor into our work without being overbearing. |
| Accomplishment | 3 | 6 | I've taken several teams from siloed and low-performing to being exemplary. For example, by using Lean / Agile / DevOps strategies, I was able to lead my current team to the highest SonarQube metrics and gating conditions across ~2,000 developers, and to turn them into the only DevOps-capable team deploying at 6x the rest of the org in a group of ~100 developers. I've also used coaching to halt departures and drastically increase engagement. I've done this for years in different situations. | 
| *Sub-Total* | | **18** |
| **Strengthening** |
| Mentorship | 4 | 12 | I run Radical Candor style 1:1s for technical coaching with 7 developers currently, and as many as 12 concurrent developers in the past. Most of my work has been with engineers, but I've also mentored architects and coached managers and executives. Many of the younger developers I've mentored have gone on to become tech leads, architects. I've co-founded an Agile guild, a Software Improvement club, and a Cloud Native Learning club to impact multiple teams in my business unit. | 
| Evangelism | 2 | 3 | I'm an IBM Lab Advocate. This is the first time I've represented my company externally as an evangelist. I have done significant consulting in the past. |
| Recruiting | 1 | 1 | I've been a hiring manager in the past on multiple occasions. I've conducted over 200 technical internviews and created an interviewing process. I've also built up multiple teams from scratch. However, I haven't been as involved in this in the recent past. | 
| Community | 3 | 6 | I work hard to build bridges. My last project is testament to that because my group had to work with over 30 groups on various topics. There would be no chance of success if we hadn't brought all of our collaborative abilities to bear. Additionally, I participate in org-wide discussions and help foster a learning culture by giving occasional talks and participating in our Learning Club and Agile Guild. |
